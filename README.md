# Annoying Headings Blocker
This project is a Chrome extension that blocks any heading containing keywords specified by the user. The user chooses whether the keyword is case-sensitive. The script also works when new content appears on the page (e.g. when scrolling facebook). <br/><br/>
It can be useful if you're tired of reading headlines on a particular topic, or you don't like a particular influencer or want to avoid spoilers.
